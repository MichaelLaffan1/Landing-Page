# Landing-Page
Landing Page Project for the Odin Project

This project serves as a checkpoint in the Odin Project Curriculum for me to showcase my skills
so far. My skillset so far includes utilizing HTML for structuring web pages, CSS to style web pages, giving them color and making them appealing, and Flexbox, which is used to structure elements ultlizing containers.

In this project, I will be making a sample landing page for a business website. This project will help to showcase what I've learned so far and what I will be using later on in the curriculum. By completing this project, I will hope to have gained knowledge and skill in utilizing HTML, CSS and Flexbox to make sample web pages.
